# MettiForArtists
MettiForArtists is an open-source smart contract started by Pumpametti that allows artists with limited or no technical background to mint NFT artworks on their own custom contracts instead of using OpenSea Storefront Contract. With MettiForArtists you can mint unique artworks or art editions all under your artist name, set irrevocable artwork links for your unique artworks or editions, also set artwork royalties from 0% to 20%. More detailed tutorial and peer help will be availalble in Pumpametti Discord dev-Chat. No artist should starve due to technical barrier. https://linktr.ee/Pumpametti
